"""Time-Series Builder (Milestone 6.2)

Produces basic date-indexed match density & outcome aggregates for a team.

Current outputs (per team):
 - date (ISO YYYY-MM-DD)
 - matches_played: number of matches (scheduled or completed) that day
 - completed: number of matches with recorded scores that day
 - wins: count of wins that day (team perspective)
 - losses: count of losses that day
 - cumulative_win_pct: running win percentage across all completed matches up to that date

Design Notes:
 - Read-only; uses existing repositories through a fresh repository facade.
 - Availability coverage (future: integrate once availability schema implemented) is left as TODO.
 - Keeps computation in pure Python (dataset sizes expected small enough) â€“ can be optimized later.
