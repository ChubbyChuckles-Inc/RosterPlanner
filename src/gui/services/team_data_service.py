"""TeamDataService (Milestone 5.9.6)

Bridges repository layer (SQLite-backed) to GUI bundle objects used by
`TeamDetailView` and `RosterLoadWorker`.

Current scope (incremental):
 - Fetch team entity by id (from teams repository) â€“ if missing returns None
 - Fetch players for team (players repository)
 - Fetch matches for team (matches repository) and convert to simple match date list
 - Produce `TeamRosterBundle` (existing GUI model) with PlayerEntry + MatchDate objects

Defer advanced parsing / enriched attributes (e.g., LivePZ history, opponent names) to
later milestones once ingestion covers those tables fully.
