"""Continuous design snapshot pipeline utilities (Milestone 0.29).

This module provides primitives for capturing deterministic image hashes of
rendered widgets or surfaces to enable nightly regression detection. The full
pipeline (scheduling, storage, diff UI) will be implemented incrementally; here
we focus on hash computation and a pluggable capture abstraction.

Design Goals
------------
- Keep capture decoupled from PyQt6 until integration phase: the capture input is
  bytes-like (e.g., PNG) rather than a QWidget directly for testability.
- Deterministic hashing via SHA256 of raw bytes.
- Lightweight record object to store metadata for future diffing.

Future Extensions (not implemented yet):
- Automatic diffing and highlighting changed regions.
- Persisting historical baseline sets per component variant.
- Scheduling (cron-like) using an app-level job scheduler.
